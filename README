This project originates from discussion on LinkedIN (http://lnkd.in/dhrEf9) about storing images in database versus filesystem.

Not having experience with the difference in performance of the approaches, I had to try it out. 
This "test" copies 20 small gif-images to 10 000 copies to both mysql-database and Public/Img and generates html-pages refering to either directly to file or to image.php with ID of the image.

My results were : Storing images into database and getting them by ID is (only) 8.7 % faster. What are Your results?
